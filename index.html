                        Welcome to my portfolio! Here’s a little bit about me: I’m a guitar lover who enjoys strumming my way through life, even if I’m not the best player out there. Music is my happy place! I also have a knack for cooking, but let’s just say my dishes often turn out a bit… interesting. Who knew pancakes could be so tricky?
                        <br><br>
                        Next to this paragraph, you’ll see a photo of my amazing wife. She’s my biggest supporter and puts up with my cooking experiments, which is pretty awesome!
                        <br><br>
                        This portfolio is my intro to coding, and I’m excited to share my journey with you. I’m learning new things every day, and I can’t wait to see where this takes me. Thanks for checking it out!
